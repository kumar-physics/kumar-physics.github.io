# Welcom to my space


I am a structural biologist and data scientist passionate about applying data-driven approaches to advance biomolecular research. Currently, I hold the position of Lead Analyst at the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) at UConn Health. In this role, I lead NMR biocuration and validation efforts at the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) consortium. A significant aspect of my work involves developing tools and workflows that facilitate scalable, standardized, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices. These principles are fundamental in data science and ensure that the data is prepared for efficient machine learning model training. Additionally, I am developing machine learning models by combining information from the Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) and BMRB at various levels, including the sequence, residue, and atom levels.

At the BMRB, I have designed interactive data visualization tools and am currently developing comprehensive, automated validation reporting systems that align with machine-learning–oriented metadata curation goals. My work spans the full data lifecycle, including schema design, ontology integration, and longitudinal data tracking—critical components for ML model training and reproducibility. Throughout, I have remained committed to advancing data-driven science through scalable infrastructure, robust modeling frameworks, and collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches.
