# Projects

My research explores data-driven structural biology, combining experimental NMR data and machine learning.  
Some key areas include:

- **Chemical shift referencing & validation** â€” through the *PyLACS* system.  
- **FAIR data pipelines** for biomolecular archives like BMRB and wwPDB.  
- **Machine learning models** predicting protein secondary structure from NMR data.  
- **Metadata annotation** and schema development (mmCIF, STAR, JSON).

These projects aim to enhance data reliability and computational reproducibility.
