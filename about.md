# About Me

I'm **Kumaran Baskaran**, a data scientist and structural biologist focusing on integrating
biomolecular NMR data with AI-driven models to improve chemical shift validation,
metadata standardization, and FAIR-compliant data pipelines.

This page summarizes my background and ongoing work with **BMRB** and **wwPDB**.
